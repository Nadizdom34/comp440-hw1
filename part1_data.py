Part 1: whose data is this?

    uv run python part1_data.py

Write your own cut rule and your two checks before you run anything here. Doing it in that
order is what Part 1 is asking for. What this script must print, under the labels shown:

    == (a) how much ==
        Rows in each of the four files, distinct users, distinct movies, and the share of
        all 32,000,204 MovieLens ratings this set holds.

    == (b) spread ==
        Ratings per user and ratings per movie: median, minimum and maximum of each. Tag
        applications per user and per movie: the same three. How many of the users who
        rated anything ever applied a tag, as a count and as a share.

    == (c) top tags, two ways ==
        The 20 most-used tags by number of applications, and the 20 most-used tags by number
        of distinct users who applied them. Print the two lists one after the other, with
        both numbers on every row, so you can see where a tag's two ranks differ.

    == (d) two checks ==
        Two claims from (a) to (c) re-derived by a route that does not reuse the code that
        produced them, printed with both numbers side by side and the word MATCH or DIFFER.
        Targets that exist in this data: the share of all 32M ratings the set holds
        (`data/README.md` says 15.6 percent); the number of distinct users who applied a
        tag (14,019); the rating count of the least-rated kept movie (83); the 6 tag
        rows whose text is literally `NA`, which vanish if a reader is built without
        `keep_default_na=False`.

No figures are required in Part 1. `WRITEUP.md` takes one interesting thing from
`data/README.md`, your own cut rule and the rule you rejected, how `data/make_compact.py`'s
rule differs from yours, and your two checks.
